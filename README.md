coding challenges on iycf indicators calculation

1. The project: You have been assigned to prepare a report for the Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) indicator survey. The report should include a frequency table (disagrigated by gender, geographical location) and plots for the key IYCF indicators. There are no specific content or template requirements, but these elements are mandatory.
2. R-package: please download [here](https://nutriverse.io/riycf/index.html)
3. Articles: We have provided reference articles that explain how to calculate the IYCF (Infant and Young Child Feeding) indicators. The articles also include sample R code that shows how to calculate each key indicator. However, please note that you cannot directly apply this R code. You are requested to use the tidyverse package command to process all new variable development work. For example, you should use the "mutate" function with the pipe "%>%" instead of using base R.
